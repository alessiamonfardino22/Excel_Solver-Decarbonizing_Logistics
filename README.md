# Excel_Solver-Decarbonizing_Logistics
Through the use of Excel Solver, my team ptimized a supply chain to reduce carbon emissions.

The CFO of the company limits the available budget to run the given Supply Chain to CNY 3 billion. We tried to reduce or increase the budget to verify if it would result in a more efficient supply chain with regards to a lesser impact on CO2. 

You can find the report we presented to the company taking into consideration a non-technical audience.
